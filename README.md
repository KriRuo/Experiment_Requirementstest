## BA Methods Matrix

The **BA Methods Matrix** helps practitioners quickly identify the right method for their situation.

📊 **[View the BA Methods Matrix](BA_Methods_Matrix.md)**

### What's Inside

The matrix provides a structured lookup table that maps:
- **Problem/Situation** → The challenge you're facing
- **BA Method** → The technique that solves it
- **Short Description** → What the method does
- **Key Steps** → How to execute it (3-6 actionable steps)
- **Goal** → What you'll achieve
- **Deliverable** → The concrete artifact you'll produce

### Coverage

The matrix covers 38+ problem scenarios including:
- Vision and strategy alignment
- Stakeholder management
- Requirements elicitation and clarity
- Prioritization and decision-making
- Process modeling and optimization
- Architecture and integration
- Quality and non-functional requirements
- Validation and testing
- Data modeling
- Business case development
- Change and risk management

### Standards Supported

- IREB (International Requirements Engineering Board)
- BABOK (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge)
- Agile/Scrum practices
- SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)
- Lean/Six Sigma principles
- UX/Design Thinking methods

## AI-Enabled BA Deliverables Catalog

The **AI-Enabled BA Deliverables Catalog** provides detailed guidance on creating and accelerating BA deliverables using modern AI techniques.

🤖 **[View the AI-Enabled Deliverables Catalog](AI_Enabled_BA_Deliverables_Catalog.md)**

### What's Inside

A comprehensive catalog of 16 essential BA deliverables, each with:
- **Problem(s) Solved** - What challenges this deliverable addresses
- **Description & Purpose** - Clear explanation of the artifact
- **Core Components** - What must be included
- **Quality Criteria** - Standards for "good" deliverables
- **Typical Inputs & Consumers** - Source materials and stakeholders
- **Format Examples** - Common templates and tools
- **AI Acceleration** - Concrete prompts, automations, and validations (minimum 3 per deliverable)
- **Typical Mistakes** - Common pitfalls to avoid
- **Review Checklist** - 3-5 item quality check
- **When NOT to Use** - Situations where this artifact isn't appropriate

### Deliverables Covered

1. Vision Canvas
2. Stakeholder Map
3. Context Diagram
4. BPMN Process Model
5. User Story Map
6. Product Backlog
7. Use Case Specification
8. Data Model
9. NFR Catalog
10. Acceptance Criteria
11. Prototype / Wireframe
12. Impact Analysis
13. Business Case
14. Definition of Ready
15. Test Concept
16. Release Plan

### AI Acceleration Patterns

The catalog includes executable AI techniques such as:
- ✨ **Generate X from Y** - Draft creation from source materials
- ✅ **Review for gaps** - Quality validation against checklists
- 📝 **Meeting notes → artifacts** - Extract deliverables from transcripts
- 📊 **Text → diagrams** - Generate Mermaid/BPMN visualizations
- 🔗 **Consistency checks** - Cross-artifact validation
- 🧪 **Test generation** - From requirements to test cases
- 🎯 **Traceability** - Link requirements to implementation

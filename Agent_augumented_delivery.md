## Goal
Outline and list alternative ai augumented delivery methods/practices


## Ralph-claude-code
(https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code)<br>
Description
- A looping method that prioritizes vertical completeness before picking up the next feature.

Strengths
- Iterative loops

Weeknesses

Example

## Spec driven development "kit" (SDD)
Description

"Spec-Driven Development flips the script on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: specifications become executable, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them."

Strengths
- Project produces accurate documentation
- Present documentation leveraged


Weeknesses
- Demands early, rigid documentation
-

## Vibe-Kanban
Description
- Multi agent kanban platform.

## BMAD-Method
Description
2 Paths
- Simple path for quick fixes
- Full planning path (BMad method)

/product-brief — define problem, users, and MVP scope
/create-prd — full requirements with personas, metrics, and risks
/create-architecture — technical decisions and system design
/create-epics-and-stories — break work into prioritized stories
/sprint-planning — initialize sprint tracking
Repeat per story: /create-story → /dev-story → /code-review

Strengths
- Iterative process for creating clarity in
Weaknesses

## Recognized patterns in the methods
- *Careful planning*- The importance of planning and even iterating on plans before execution is clear in agentic software development
(Supported by study by Anthropic on Plan mode increasing agent output quality)
- *The quality of the requirements*- determine to a higher degree the quality of the outcome than old school agile software delivery.
- *Be specific* - Being specific when defining requirements, wishes, changes etc. is more important when the human-to-human understanding and intuition is gone. The machine only knows what you express in clear text.
- *Leverage loops* - Working in repetitive cycles, iterations, 
- *Carefully defined skills*
- *Carefully defined guardrails*
- *Carefully defined context layer*
- *Multi agentic development*

## Trends recognized in the Agentic software delivery market
- Context windows are growing rapidly.
- Token monsters are appearing (i.e. Opus 4.6)
- The users judgement is the great asset which Agents dont have
- .md "Agent" rules are standard, not emerging.
- Limitation seemingly rather on providing enough accurate input than processing requests correctly

## Finnish provokers
- What fuels "good judgement" in users?
- How can an organization opimize for "good judgement"
- What is "good judgement"-> Exposure of great content, what is useful, what is tasteful, what is valuable
- 
## Kris Predictions
- More work upfront than in agile software delivery
-

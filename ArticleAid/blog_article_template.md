Title
Clear. Direct. Concept-driven.
Avoid hype or exaggerated framing.
1. The Tension
Open with a real professional tension.
Examples:
A recurring failure pattern
A misleading industry assumption
A contradiction in current AI discourse
A risk emerging in regulated environments
Keep this section concise (5–8 paragraphs max).
Goal: Create intellectual friction.
2. Core Thesis
State the main claim explicitly.
Structure:
Thesis: [Clear, defensible statement]
No ambiguity.
No marketing tone.
3. Conceptual Decomposition
Break the thesis into a structured model.
Options:
Comparison table
Layered model
Framework (2–5 components)
Process chain
Rules:
Give the model a name.
Define each element precisely.
Avoid introducing unnecessary new terminology.
If referencing prior articles, maintain terminology consistency.
Example structure:
Element
Description
Risk if Ignored
This is the intellectual backbone of the article.
4. Practical Implications for BA/RE and Service Providers
Make it operational.
Structure as:
For Business Analysts / REs
Bullet points
Clear behavioral shifts
Concrete practices
For Service Providers
Organizational implications
Delivery model impact
Capability shifts
Avoid abstraction.
5. Governance & Risk Considerations
Every article must include a governance dimension.
Discuss:
Accountability boundaries
Traceability implications
Audit or compliance risks
Failure modes
This reinforces your differentiation.
6. Counterpoint or Limitation
Intellectual credibility requires tension.
Address:
Where this model may not apply
What assumptions are embedded
What critics might argue
Avoid defensiveness.
7. Forward Link
End with a forward-looking but grounded transition.
Either:
Link to the next article
Expand the series thesis
Pose a structured open question
Example:
If context defines AI behavior, the next question becomes: how should context be structured?
Keep it calm. Not dramatic.
Structural Constraints for AI Generation
When generating:
1200–1600 words target
At least one table or model
No buzzwords without definition
No repeated filler transitions
Maintain consistent terminology across articles
No metaphors unless necessary and precise
Optional Add-On Sections (Use When Relevant)
Case Illustration (Short)
Use a realistic but anonymized example from:
Regulated industry
Cross-functional delivery
Audit scenario
Diagnostic Checklist
A short evaluation tool readers can apply.
Mini-Framework Summary Box
3–5 bullet recap.
